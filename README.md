# CollatzSequence
Explore the Collatz Sequence

This program will explore what is called the Collatz Sequence. This is sometimes called the simplest impossible math problem.

The input will be a number that can be any integer. 

If the number is even, the program should print the number // 2. 
If the number is odd it will print 3 * the number + 1.  

The sequence will repeat using the new number and end when it reaches a value of 1. 

Any integer can be input and all will eventually end at 1. Mathmaticians are not sure why.
